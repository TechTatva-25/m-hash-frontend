// #### Round 1

// Problem-Solving and Thought Process Evaluation (Online)
//     The PowerPoint presentation, adhering to the format provided in the rulebook, will serve as a visual aid for the panel of judges to get an insight of proposed solution. Participants must effectively communicate their ideas, methodologies, and potential outcomes. Clarity, coherence, and logical flow in the presentation will be essential criteria for evaluation. Additionally, participants should ensure that their presentations are visually engaging and professionally designed.

// #### Round 2

// 36-Hour Coding Challenge (offline: MIT Manipal campus)
//     The second round will be the ultimate test of the shortlisted teams' technical skills and ability to apply their problem-solving approach in a real-time scenario. This round will be a 36-hour coding challenge, during which teams will have to code, implement, and present their solutions. Teams would be required to stay in the premises of the venue for the whole duration of the round.

// ### Eligibility criteria

// > Only students pursuing their Undergraduate or Postgraduate courses in any field of Engineering can participate in the hackathon. A bona fide student certificate and a valid college ID is mandatory. A team of 2-5 people is mandatory to participate in the hackathon. The team members can be from different academic levels (years/programs) but belong to the same college. Students currently enrolled in Undergraduate and Postgraduate courses may also team up with each other. But must belong to the same college. Once a team has registered, any changes in the team members will not be entertained. A participant can be a part of only one team during the entire course of the hackathon. Parents, Mentors or guardians would not be allowed to accompany the qualified teams for the Final Round held offline.

// > Note: Teams are not supposed to disclose their institute name or logo at any point during the hackathon (Except while registering for the competition). This would be to ensure judgement is purely based on the solutions presented.

- If a team qualifies for the offline round at MIT, **at least two** members must be present.

# Guidelines for Round 1

## For Submission:

- Submissions of the ppt and video must adhere to the specified layout.
- Design of the ppt can be changed but the layout must remain as is.
- No extensions will be granted upon missing the deadline.
- Each team can choose only one problem statement and make only one submission.
- Any mention of the **institute name** in the submission will lead to **disqualification**.

## For Project:

# Round Description

## Round 1: Ideation (Online)

In Round 1, participants must submit a presentation and video in the format provided in the subsequent pages. Submissions will be evaluated based on the judgment criteria, details of which are also provided below. The top 30 teams will be selected to advance to the second round.

## Round 2: Execution (Onsite)

The second round will be the execution phase at MIT, Manipal. It will be a 36-hour coding challenge where teams will code, implement, and present their solutions. Participants are required to stay on the premises for the entire duration of the round. The outcome of the challenge must be a functional working prototype. Further details regarding Round 2 will be provided at a later date.

# Round 1 PPT Format

## Slide One:

- Team name and a **single group photo** in one frame
- Members List, with the full name of the member (as printed on the college ID)
- **DO NOT** mention the institution's name

## Slide Two:

- ID number of the problem statement along with the problem title
- Problem Statement ID and solution not matching would lead to **disqualification**

## Slide Three:

- Introduction and Background of the problem statement

## Slide Four:

Specify opportunities and limitations of existing technology for the issues identified

## Next 1 or 2 Slides:

- Description of the solution
- Features proposed (must be present in the final project; additional features can be added, but not implementing the aforementioned features will lead to penalties)

## Next Slide:
